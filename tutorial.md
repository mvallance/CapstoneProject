# Tutorial

**Introduction**

&#x20;****&#x20;

Medical researchers often need to confirm the reliability of the physiological data displayed by biodata devices. The following experiment is supported by prior research published in an international peer-reviewed journal.

&#x20;

**Required**

&#x20;****&#x20;

o   Windows or Apple Mac computer

o   Oculus Quest HMD

o   Polyworld PC game:

o   Polyworld VR game

o   Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)

o   Cybatica app

o   iPhone 13 Pro

&#x20;

o   All items can be loaned upon request to our Lead Programmer (email:&#x20;

o   lp@iverg.com).

o   Please state your Companies House ID code.&#x20;

o   Available only in UK.

&#x20;

**Procedure**

&#x20;

Follow the procedure as shown below.

It is advised to randomize the use PC and VR as initial experience.

&#x20;

1\.     Sit down and relax (5 minutes)

2\.     Measure physiological data as the base condition in Cybatica (5 minutes)

3\.     Carry out PC or VR task following in-game instructions (5 minutes)

4\.     Record OCS physiological data in the PC (or VR) condition in Cybatica (5 minutes)

5\.     Answer SSQ and rest for 5 minutes

6\.     Carry out VR or PC task following in-game instructions (5 minutes)

7\.     Record OCS physiological data in the VR (or PC) condition in Cybatica (5 minutes)

8\.     Answer SSQ

9\.     Rest (5 minutes). An optional post-experiment survey can be undertaken.&#x20;

10\.  To compare data you need to calculate the self-report SSQ values.

o   Obtain values a^’ and b^’ and c^’ from the survey.

&#x20;

Calculate the following symptoms scores:

* Nausea Score = a^'\* 9.54
* Oculomotor Score = b^'\* 7.58
* Disorientation Score = c^' \* 13.93

Calculate the SSQ score:

* SSQ = (a^'+b^'+c') \* 3.74

&#x20;

**Compare the SSQ score with the OCS value displayed on the Cybatica app.**
