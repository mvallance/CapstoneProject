# Tutorial

**Introduction**

Medical researchers often need to confirm the reliability of the physiological data displayed by biodata devices. The following experiment is supported by prior research published in an international peer-reviewed journal.

**Required**

o   Windows or Apple Mac computer

o   Oculus Quest HMD

o   Polyworld PC game:

o   Polyworld VR game

o   Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)

o   Cybatica app

o   iPhone 13 Pro

All items can be loaned upon request to our Lead Programmer (email: lp@iverg.com).

Available only in UK.

**Procedure**

Follow the procedure as shown below.

It is advised to randomize the use PC and VR as initial experience.

1\.     Sit down and relax (5 minutes)

2\.     Measure physiological data as the base condition in Cybatica (5 minutes)

3\.     Carry out PC or VR task following in-game instructions (5 minutes)

4\.     Record OCS physiological data in the PC (or VR) condition in Cybatica (5 minutes)

5\.     Answer SSQ and rest for 5 minutes

6\.     Carry out VR or PC task following in-game instructions (5 minutes)

7\.     Record OCS physiological data in the VR (or PC) condition in Cybatica (5 minutes)

8\.     Answer SSQ

9\.     Rest (5 minutes). An optional post-experiment survey can be undertaken.&#x20;

10\.  To compare data you need to calculate the self-report SSQ values.

&#x20;

Calculate the following symptoms scores.

You obtain values a^’ and b^’ and c^’ from the survey.

* Nausea Score = a^'\* 9.54
* Oculomotor Score = b^'\* 7.58
* Disorientation Score = c^' \* 13.93

Calculate the SSQ score:

* SSQ = (a^'+b^'+c') \* 3.74

**Compare the SSQ score with the OCS value displayed on the Cybatica app.**
