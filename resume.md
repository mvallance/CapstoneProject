# Resume

**Summary**

I have been involved in technology design, implementation, research and consultancy teaching Technical and Media Communication (e.g., writing and communicating for a range of multimedia modalities) and Academic Literacy in Higher Education. With a background and extensive knowledge in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, Design and Virtual Reality, I have written over 160 peer-reviewed academic journal publications, technical reports and research funding applications; both as an independent author and also with collaborative partners.  As a researcher and writer I have worked with program managers, UI designers, software development engineers, business leaders and administrators, effectively communicating content, processes, outcomes, data analysis, recommendations and promotions. I am well versed in all communication technologies, and have advanced skills particularly in the use of emerging metaverse applications and implementations. With my varied academic, technical writing and journalist skills and experience, I believe I would be a great fit for this position, applying my experience and skills to help your team achieve its goals.
